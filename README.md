What is a high flow faucet adapter? An adaptor is a hose that connects your existing faucet with a high-flow showerhead or sink. There are several types of adaptors available, and choosing the right one for your home is essential for increasing water efficiency and saving money. These hoses are made of rubber or rezimar, and have metal erswivel couplings and bodies. They are usually made of a swivel coupling and have two separate large water passages. The swivel connection allows the connector to fit your faucet tightly.

<b>Find the A 1.0GPM</b>

An adapter is very useful for people who are trying to reduce their water bills by 50%. A 1.0GPM flow rate isn't that much less than 2.2GPM, and many people find it to be acceptable. The best way to test the flow rate of your current faucet is by using a small container filled with water and a stopwatch. You can then compare the two. If the hoses are the same size, you'll need to purchase one with a higher flow rate to reduce your water bill.
